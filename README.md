# covid_nursing_home_data
This is a simple program to read web-available COVID nursing home data 
It provides a simple R program that reads data from 
https://data.cms.gov/Special-Programs-Initiatives-COVID-19-Nursing-Home/COVID-19-Nursing-Home-Dataset/s2uc-8wxp/data
I just thought folk would find this useful to track what is happening.
